    It seems like the main elements of Alchemy of Souls are soul, 
    blood and water. 
    So, let's start with them.
</pre>

<p style="font-size:13px;">There are a lot of interpretations for soul but most agree that it is the ethereal substance, the non-material part of body. Some name it the breath of universe.</p>

<p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Body is named as tabernacle of soul. So, I guess people who lost their minds and become stone symbolise their inability to protect their souls. The real souls of body, for not protecting themselves, and the soul for taking someone else's body.</p>

<p>Blood is often associated with<sub>life,</sub>death,<sup>redemption,</sup> innocence,<sub>massacre,</sub><sup>malediction.</sup>I think in a way, it is connected to reflection of souls.</p>
<p> <ins>Water popularly</ins> represents life and has been used to communicate the sacred value of life.<mark>So, powers related to it, I guess, directly affects the lives of both the user and affected side.</mark>This might be why it requires <del>lots of energy.</del> </p>

    <q>The water dragons are healers, warriors, and peace gathering clans. The water dragon is said to bring peace and unity where only war was before.</q>

<p> Eyes represent gateway into the soul. That might be why <abbr title="Miss">Ms.</abbr> Naksu's mark appeared in Mudeok's eyes.</p>

<p><cite>Blue</cite> is a spiritual color, so it is very clever to use it as a mark. Color represents both <cite>sky and sea</cite> (they did mention how energy come from sky to ground) and is associated with open spaces, freedom, intuition, inspiration, and sensitivity.</p>
